# Go Generics Reference Module

A collection of common generic functional utilities, data structures,
and concurrency patterns implemented in Go using generics.

This project aims to provide well-documented, performant, and safe examples
for learning and using Go generics effectively.

## Project Structure

- `/functional`: Generic functions (Map, Filter, Reduce, etc.).
- `/ds`: Generic data structures (Stack, Queue, Set, etc.).
- `/concurrency`: Concurrency patterns using generics (ParallelMap, WorkerPool, etc.).
- `/examples`: Usage examples and tests demonstrating the components.
